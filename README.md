Hypixel Auto-Report: Automatically ignores/reports bots advertising TheMcZone.

## Side Note
Do not blame TheMcZone for these bots, this mod was meant to help the server.

These bots were purchased or created by a random, unknown individual who wanted to harm the server by getting people to flood it with toxicity and hate. The owner of the server even gave a bit of help with the creation of this mod! Please, stop joining to spam the server, you're just giving the bot owner what they want.

## Disclaimer!

Do not run this mod server-side! The server WILL crash! This is a client-side mod ONLY.

The source code is NOT fully functional on the repository, it is missing the filter list I use to block multiple message variants, this is  to preserve the security of the list itself.
